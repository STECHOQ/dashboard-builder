# Demo

# Features  
current features :
- **Page** : Page is components wrapper. Path's name is auto generated by Page's name. After you build it, you can try to access each page by go to their path (e.g. for page `Test`, you can access it like `localhost:9000/test`).   
`Default Page` will be used to re-route your root path into it, so make sure that you have `Default Page` in your project.
- **Component** : component consist of iframe html. You can edit them directly from our web builder. we also provide some component templates too. 
- **Export**: it would export your current project into json, so you can use it later.
- **Import**: to import your project's json.
- **Build**: to build your project into vite dist. it consist html, js, and css like usual. like any other current dist result, it focus all of its paths to /index.html, so you need to re-route it.  

Please be aware that your project is not stored on localStorage or anything. it means if you try to refresh the page, your project will be disappear.
